<p>&nbsp;About 15% of all papers I edit have manually inserted citations and references. Fifteen percent! I find this both baffling and frustrating. Why on earth would you put yourself through the process of typing in all those references? And on a more ego-centric note, why would you put an editor (me!) through the process of checking the formatting of all of these when a programme could do it for you for free?</p>
<p>It is not <em>just</em> that counting author names and checking punctuation are the least exciting aspects of editing papers, it is also very difficult to get a reference list completely error-free, even after multiple rounds of editing. It takes a lot of time and effort to spot small inconsistencies, let alone to find mistakes in issue or page numbers.&nbsp;Currently, a human editor still beats a machine when it comes to handling text, but references are definitely an exception to this rule.</p>
<p><strong>What is a reference manager and why do you need one?</strong></p>
<p>Reference management is so much more than adding citations during writing. Use reference software to build and organise your literature database on a day-to-day basis. It allows you to keep track of the papers you have read and those on your reading list. You can highlight important sections, make notes and keep them all in a database that you can access on different mobile devices or share with your colleagues.</p>
<p>When you write, you will have all your papers and your notes ready at your fingertips in a searchable database. Inserting references will be a piece of cake: your reference list will be generated automatically and, most importantly, error-free. Should you decide to submit your paper to a different journal, you can adapt the citation style with one mouse click. Writing papers will instantly become a much more enjoyable exercise!</p>
<p>So if you were not using a reference manager already, I hope I have convinced to start using one this minute. It is really easy, anyone can do it. If you are supervising students, teach them early on how to manage their literature database. It is just as important as keeping track of experiments and protocols.</p>
<p><strong>What are the options?</strong></p>
<p>There is a wide range of software for reference management, and I just list three of the most mainstream ones here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://endnote.com/" target="_blank">Endnote</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is still the most widely used reference management software package. Many scientists seem to stick to EndNote and I am not sure why. It has been around for ever and remains the default choice in many institutes despite its considerable price tag!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mendeley.com/" target="_blank">Mendeley</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been a happy Mendeley user for many years. I like the intuitive interface, the annotation features and the app. Mendeley is free (online storage up to 2 GB) but a big downside is that it&nbsp;has been bought by Elsevier. While they have kept Mendeley free so far, they have acces to all search and sharing data of its users (as they say, if it&rsquo;s free, you&rsquo;re probably the product!). <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/when-the-rebel-alliance-sells-out">Here</a> you can read more about why that may worry you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zotero.com/" target="_blank">Zotero</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An important plus of Zotero is that it is free and open source. Since it works as a plug-in, it does not have a built-in system for pdf viewing or annotation, so you&rsquo;ll still need a separate pdf reader such as Adobe. In its early days, Zotero was <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7214/full/455708a.html" target="_blank">sued</a> by Thomson Reuters (who develop EndNote) because it allowed for the conversion of EndNotes .ens style files into open source .csl style files that can be used by other programmes. The lawsuit was dismissed, and Zotero is increasingly popular with researchers who value data sharing, open access and open source initiatives.</p>
<p>Other popular platforms include Papers (which used to be Mac-only, but now also available for Windows), RefWorks, and Reference Manager, but none of these are free. Besides these, many more alternatives exist, and you can find detailed comparisons of their advantages and disadvantages&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maxmasnick.com/2015/02/28/reference-managers/" target="_blank">here</a>,<a href="http://guides.library.utoronto.ca/c.php?g=250610&amp;p=1671260" target="_blank">here</a> and on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Which program is best for you depends on your needs, which word processor you use and perhaps also on which system is already in use by others in your group. You can easily export your reference database across different platforms, so why not give a few different ones a try and see what works best for you?</p>
