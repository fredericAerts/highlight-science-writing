<p>Writing may represent only an infinitesimal part of your work as a researcher, but&nbsp;it can make or break how all the other aspects are perceived. In the current scientific culture, your written output and its impact are the measures of your success, so you better bring&nbsp;your A game when preparing any publication. Here are some of the most important aspects that set a great paper apart from an average one (apart from the actual results, of course!):</p>
<p><strong>Even a paper needs a storyline</strong></p>
<p>A scientific publication is not a work of fiction, but nevertheless it needs to tell a story. This storyline needs to be clearly defined before putting a single letter on paper. You can compare this storyline to a scenario of which you put together the different scenes when assembling your figure panels. It is worth taking your time for this initial planning phase to think things through very carefully. Research data can often be presented in a number of different ways, so why not try out different scenario&rsquo;s and discuss them with your colleagues and/or supervisor? Chances are that other researchers have done (or are doing) very similar experiments and you need to present your data in such a way that it&rsquo;s very obvious what your angle is and how your data bring to the table. Your introduction should not be a short review of your field, it should guide your audience to the conclusion that what urgently needs to be done, is exactly what you did. Your results section should not be an activity report, but a carefully constructed set of arguments to make your case. This may seem obvious, but all too often papers are cluttered with unnecessary information, which distracts reviewers and readers from the actual impact of your work. If you have a solid storyline, it will be much easier to write up a paper that is focused and easy to follow.</p>
<p><strong>It is not about showing how smart you are</strong></p>
<p>Everything you ever write, be it a paper, a thesis, a book or a presentation, should always be about the audience; if they don&rsquo;t get your message, why did you even bother to communicate? Unfortunately, because of the fierce competition in academic research, there is still a strong tendency for machoism. Especially younger researchers may feel the need to impress by using way too much academic lingo, while you should really make your publication as simple as possible. Your readers (and your reviewers) would much rather read a clearly written paper, than one with unnecessary jargon, littered with citations that really don&rsquo;t have that much to do with your results. Ask yourself, which papers do you enjoy reading and why? Remember that your audience is not your advisor, and write a paper that you would enjoy reading yourself. Does this mean you have to simplify your science? Certainly not! Just be down to earth and let your results shine, not the author.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t overstate or oversell your findings</strong></p>
<p>We have all been there: our super cool idea did not yield the expected result, or due to technical limitations our results are less black-and-white than we would have liked. Everyone is in favour of publishing negative results, but as you may have experienced, writing them down is not always easy. Even when the results are positive, we can be tempted to emphasise some aspects, after all, we have worked so hard on it and journals want to see novelty and impact!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate your readers (and reviewers). They are smart, and if they even smell a whiff of exaggeration or compensation behaviour, they will automatically turn very critical towards all of your statements. A small or modest result, with the correct evidence and controls and honest discussion of the limitations and implications will have a more convincing impact than a result that is more spectacular but at the same time more controversial.</p>
<p>This aspect of scientific publishing is covered by every ethics course or workshop, and you may be convinced that it does not apply to you. However, overstatements can sneak in very subtly in your text. For example, your negative result may lead you to use a vague title for your figure, instead of an informative one. Where you would go for &ldquo;&lsquo;Downregulation of X affects Y activity&rsquo; when your results showed a clear effect, a negative result might lead you to use the title &lsquo;Effect of X downregulation on Y activity&rsquo;, instead of &lsquo;Downregulation of X does not affect Y activity&rsquo;, but you are just postponing what the reader will eventually find out, and when s/he does, they might feel misled. The same is true for reporting &lsquo;differences, which did not reach statistical significance&rsquo;. Would you be using the word &lsquo;differences&rsquo; if the results were the other way around?</p>
<p><strong>Ditch the weasel words</strong></p>
<p>Weasel words are &ldquo;words that are used in order to evade or retreat from a direct or forthright statement or position&rdquo; (Merriam-Webster dictionary). Politicians are especially well-trained in deliberately using them, but scientists have also become experts in the matter. While scientific publications should consist of nuanced claims, there is a difference between being nuanced and being vague. When writing your paper, it is essential that you can tell them apart.</p>
<p>By far the most commonly misused set of words in scientific papers is &ldquo;has/have been shown to&rdquo;. When I edit papers, I can often scratch out a dozen of those in a manuscript. Would you ever write &lsquo;The earth has been shown to be round&rsquo;? No, you wouldn&rsquo;t. Just like you would never write &lsquo;Mitochondria have been shown to produce ATP&rsquo;. It has been demonstrated, you know it, your audience knows it, you move on and write &lsquo;Mitochondria produce ATP&rsquo;. So why do you put it with every paper you cite? In that case it is even more redundant, because the citation is there, which literally means as much as &lsquo;this&nbsp;<em>has been shown</em>&nbsp;by these people&rsquo;. Sometimes, however, it is appropriate to add it to your claim, for example when you want to express a level of uncertainty or disagreement. For example: &lsquo;X has been shown to affect Y, but the interaction site has not been identified&rsquo; and &lsquo;While X has been shown to interact with Y in vitro, we did not observe specific interaction in our in vivo experiments&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we are overly cautious in our nuance, resulting in redundancy. In the sentence, &lsquo;X might potentially be a regulator of Y&rsquo;, the word &lsquo;potentially&rsquo; is of no added value.</p>
<p>During the writing process, weasel words will unavoidably pop up. A good writer will detect and delete them during the editing process.</p>
<p><strong>Less is more</strong></p>
<p>Even with a good storyline and without&nbsp;a single weasel word, a paper can be repetitive. Most authors find it difficult to adhere to journal imposed word limitations, but you may find that the best papers are rarely the longest. A good storyline will get you a long way, but any draft will need redacting and this generally means pruning your words.</p>
<p>It can be very difficult to strike the right balance between conciseness and clarity, and as the author of the paper, your judgement is biased by definition. Therefore, it is always a good idea to have someone that was not involved in the project read your draft. This person should be working in a similar field but on a different topic, so that s/he understands everything you have done but has no&nbsp;prejudices based on the specific literature. Ask them what they think the highlights and implications of your work are. If they don&rsquo;t align with what you had in mind while writing, that is not on them, but on you.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance matters</strong></p>
<p>While uniform formatting is essential for the readability of your text, you generally don&rsquo;t need to worry about it that much, as journals take care of that part when your paper is accepted (mind you, reviewers can be put off by sloppy and incoherent formatting as well!). Where you normally have more freedom, is in the formatting of your figures. Your graphs, images and tables are the heart of your publication, so the least you can do is make sure they look impeccable. There are numerous software packages out there that allow you to make professional figures and graphs, and I highly recommend familiarising yourself with some of these. Several among them are free to use, so there is no reason to restrict yourself to the default set-ups of Paint, Powerpoint or Excel. Images and graphs should be clearly labelled and the results should be straightforward to interpret. If your visuals are cluttered, try to come up with alternative ways of representing your data. Think about what you would be drawing if you had to explain your results to someone without having a computer or a print out at your disposal. If you&rsquo;d have to give a chalk talk, what would you put on the blackboard?</p>

<p><strong>Spell check, spell check, then spell check some more</strong></p>
<p>Grammatical errors and typos in your text distract the reader from what you are really trying to convey and give the impression that you were careless while writing your paper. If you put little effort into writing it, why should a reviewer feel compelled to put any effort into reading it? Getting the number of errors down to zero should be your ambition, but we all know how difficult this can be.</p>
<p>For many of us, there is a first and obvious hurdle: language. Non-native speakers may have to put extra effort and time to double check their word use and spelling, but even those with a good command of English need to be careful. Do you know when to use an em-dash instead of an en-dash? Or whether &lsquo;state of the art&rsquo; should be hyphenated? Can you switch between American and British spelling, depending on the target journal? None of us are perfect at everything, but if your English is only so-so, don&rsquo;t let your science suffer. Many journals will not even consider your paper if there are obvious grammatical issues, so if needed, enlist professional editing services before submitting your paper.</p>
<p>Even if your grammar is flawless, you are bound to make some typos. Unfortunately, our brains are wired to recognise patterns and ideas, which makes it very difficult to spot typos in our own texts. To a certain extent, spell-check software can be a great help, but usually that&rsquo;s not enough to get your text error-free. It&rsquo;s a good idea to spend some time away from your text and look at it with a fresh perspective after a few days (besides typos, this can also help you detect more general flaws in your text). Some people recommend reading the text out loud. I find it helpful to make a print out, I usually succeed in finding some typos that I missed when reading on screen. The best approach, however, is enlisting a second (or even third) set of eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Writing a good paper requires effort so take your time for it!</strong></p>
<p>All of the advice above is fairly obvious, so why is it ignored so often? Why don&rsquo;t we pay more attention to how we communicate our science? Maybe because we don&rsquo;t see it as an important part of our job? &lsquo;I am a scientist, I am not in PR or advertisement&rsquo; is something I hear all too often. Of course research is about doing good science and pushing the boundaries of knowledge, but scientific advancement also relies on interaction and communication. Don&rsquo;t count on your results to sell themselves, every successful company needs a good PR strategy. So revise your draft a few times more, follow a writing course, or get help from a professional editor if required. If you don&rsquo;t think your work is worth the time or effort, why would you expect others to feel any different?</p>
